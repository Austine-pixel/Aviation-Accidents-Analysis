## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Load CSV dataset.
   - Drop columns with excessive missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identify correlations among variables (e.g., fatalities vs. injuries).
   - Analyze accident trends over time.
3. **Key Insights & Findings**
   - Most accidents occur in clear weather (87%).
   - Takeoff, landing, and cruise are the most accident-prone phases.
   - Fatalities are relatively rare but can be catastrophic in extreme cases.
4. **Visualizations**
   - Trend analysis of accidents over time.
   - Phase-wise distribution of accidents.
   - Correlation heatmaps & bar charts for injury severity.
5. **Recommendations**
   - Improve pilot training for takeoff & landing.
   - Focus on human error & mechanical failure rather than weather.
   - Enhance in-flight monitoring for cruise-phase accidents.
